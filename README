It only contains qmail-send and qmail-smtp services that run by daemontools.

qmail installation includes big-dns and qmail-channel patches as well as domainkey and dkim signing support.

To grab the pubkey information which will be needed to create a TXT record for your sender domain(s)
check the /tmp/DKIM_TXT_RECORD_INFO.txt file like:

```
docker exec -i CONTAINER_NAME cat /tmp/DKIM_TXT_RECORD_INFO.txt
```
